# Fluxstone

This mod adds world bookmarks (or "pins" to your worlds in world list) and also allows you to do some small management over your worlds.

Currently available features are:
- World bookmarking
- Manual world backup (to .zip file)
- Toggle cheat/gametype features (can be force disabled in configs)

This is a client-side mod, which uses [FoxLoader](https://github.com/Fox2Code/FoxLoader) mod loader for ReIndev (2.9)
